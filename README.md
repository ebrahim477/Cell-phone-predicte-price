Cell Phone Price Prediction 🚀


This repository contains a machine learning and data visualization project aimed at predicting the price of cell phones based on key hardware specifications such as RAM, CPU, CPU frequency, front camera, rear camera, battery capacity, and initial memory. The project involves data collection, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and dashboard visualization to deliver meaningful insights. Additionally, a Streamlit web app is developed to interactively showcase predictions, and Power BI is used to create a comprehensive dashboard for better data visualization.
